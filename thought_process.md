These rolls are applied in order for each weapon, so the ordering is important. This means the better rolls will match first, in much the same you would decide on a roll yourself. E.g. Steelfeather PvE rolls at the top of the list are `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler + lots of other cool stuff` and the last on the list requires only `Feeding Frenzy + Swashbuckler` because if all else fails, those are the two perks you'll need; otherwise it's just cool-looking random kinetic Auto Rifle :)

This also means that, if your PvP and PvE rolls are similar (they usually aren't) that there's a chance a match is flagged and commented as a PvP roll in the DIM "Notes" section, when it could do double-duty. That's just how the wishlist feature currently works, so use your own discretion.
## Line in the Sand (PvE)
I only suggest this for completeness as it's the only Arc LFR in the power slot). Make it your lowest priority farm. Check our [Ehroar's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI4PumNVC0) for more. We're looking for Rapid Hit + Firing Line.

## Breachlight (PvP)
CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal or Quickdraw, it's just another two-burst sidearm, which is great but you don't need a wishlist for that :)

## Breachlight (PvE)
Some neat PvE combos here from [Ehroar's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) and general [PvE wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) from CoolGuy. I kind of love Breachlight so I'm going to lay down a bunch of possibilities here.

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvP)
CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

## Steelfeather Repeater (PvE)
There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

## Gallant Charge (PvP)
Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time.

## Gallant Charge (PvE)
CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon).

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvP)
CoolGuy [goes ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI) on PoLC. I'm on controller so these rolls are all about maxing our stability. Fortunately we have a pretty broad set of useful rolls as we're looking for. Randy's has Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip, so this is a pretty low priority farm (and also why it's so specific).

| Roll | Description |
| :--- | :---        |
| **PvP - "Super Picky"** | (Smallbore `or` Corkscrew Rifling `or` Chambered Compensator `or` Polygonal Rifling `or` Fluted Barrel) `and` (Tactical Mag `or` Steady Rounds `or` Flared Magwell) `and` (Rapid Hit) `and` (Explosive Rounds `or` Elemental Capacitor `or` Vorpal) `and` (Stability MW) |
| **PvP - "Super Picky (Minus Stability MW)"** | (Smallbore `or` Corkscrew Rifling `or` Chambered Compensator `or` Polygonal Rifling `or` Fluted Barrel) `and` (Tactical Mag `or` Steady Rounds `or` Flared Magwell) `and` (Rapid Hit) `and` (Explosive Rounds `or` Elemental Capacitor `or` Vorpal) `and` (Any Masterwork) |

## Patron of Lost Causes (PvE)
CoolGuy [goes ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI) on PoLC. For PvE, it's the only scout (as of now) that can roll Vorpal and Osmosis. Not a super high priority for PvE and not a terribly hard set of perks to farm.

## Martyr's Retribution (PvP)
This is for use from range, and Blast Radius doesn't do anything on Wave Frame launchers - simple wishlist here :) Why not demolitionist? You're not going to get final blows with this so much in PvP and with ALH, it will always be loaded. I'd rather have better handling or reload with Elemental Capacitor always-on.

| Roll | Description |

| **PvP - "Super Picky"** | (Hard Launch `or` Quick Launch) `and` (Any magazine) `and` (Auto-Loading Holster) `and` (Elemental Capacitor) `and` (Reload MW `or` Handling MW `or` Velocity MW) |
## Martyr's Retribution (PvE)
This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go. Threat Detector might seem odd, but it increases reload speed and because this GL doesn't do any impact damage, it will have great reload up close.

| Roll | Description |
