    summary: >
      Drewsky has a great review of the
      [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0), another
      360 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Machine Gun. From the review, it hits for
      48 crit / 38 body (TTK 0.5s / 0.83s). It's got terrific range and flinches
      like crazy.

      
      That being said, it's still a Machine Gun which tends not to be the pick
      for PvP... BUT... BUT! The SAW can roll with `Opening Shot` in the final
      column. Because the rate of fire is so low, you can single tap out shots
      and get crits across the map. Try out some Machine Gun sniping in Mayhem
      and let me know how that works out for you 沁ｯ


      Otherwise, there's no pressing reason to farm for a SAW for PvP, at least
      none moreso than any other Machine Gun.

          Any basic roll will chew up Guardians with a lot of flinch. Let's add
          `Range` and `Stability` where we can, while seeing what `Opening Shot`
          can do.

    summary: >
      The SAW is 360 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Machine Gun and is an absolute
      monster in PvE. *"But Slif, everyone says Machine Guns are crap for DPS
      so why do you even have a PvE section?!?"*


      Walk with me, grasshopper.


      This is going to be a long one because I haven't found any super detailed
      coverage of the SAW (or any other Seraph weapon save for the Hand Cannon).
      Fortunately since a High-Impact is a High-Impact (at base), Drewsky has
      a great review of the
      [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0)
      that's definitely worth watching! The SAW can't roll with most of the
      perks he discussed in that video, but it's still super solid at its base.


      * It's a Seraph weapon which means it generates Warmind Cells if you have
      Warmind mods equipped (Season 10).

      * As a High-Impact Frame, the SAW keeps anything it doesn't kill
      practically stun-locked. As the difficulty of PvE content increases, this
      becomes super important. Even if you're not doing Grandmaster Nightfalls,
      flinching challenging adds sure makes things more straightforward. Keeping
      the bosses flinched as they march towards your plate during a Seraph Tower
      event comes in handy!

      * Its base effecive `Range` is amazing. Damage falloff starts ~45m and is
      reasonable up to ~50m (-5%). You're talking maximum damage at Scout Rifle
      ranges. At maximum range, the sight overlaps your target because MGs
      don't have high-zoom sights/scopes. *This is why I'm not
      suggesting any `Range` boosting below - when I pushed the `Range` to `93`
      falloff and floors were unchanged and the recoil/handling will make it
      challenging to stay on target anyway.*

      * It's the only Machine Gun that can roll with `Vorpal` or
      `Firing Line` in the final column, which provide 15% and 25% damage
      boosts, respectively. Those are substantial increases to damage
      without requiring a kill or reload to activate. 


      If you're still not bought in, that's cool 沽汨. If you're still here, let's
      get those rolls! In order of importance:


      * Column 3:
        * 笨`Field Prep` is far and away the winner. It grants a whopping 25%
        more in reserve (223 to 278), speeds up your reload time by two seconds
        (~5.5s to ~3.5s) and increases ready and stow speed. For PvE, nothing
        else comes close. By the way, within 45m at 1,222 to 1,716 damage,
        that's an extra 67k - 94k damage available to you.

        * 笶形Auto-Loading Holster` and `Grave Robber` are the other two reload
        perks in this column and neither is worth giving up the reserve and
        handling bonuses that `Field Prep` provides.
      
      * Column 4:
        * 笨`Firing Line`: 25% damage boost when near two teammates. In
      PvE content you're nearly always with your fireteam: Strikes, Raids,
      Menagerie, Vex Offensive, Sundial, Seraph Towers... I'm comfortable
      reccomending `Firing Line` in general. It has double utility in dealing
      with adds and on boss DPS. Granted it's not your go-to for boss damage
      but since you already have it equipped for adds and Champions, may as
      well have something to do with all this ammo when you're on the boss!

        * 笨`Vorpal`: 15% damage boost to yellow bars and Champions. It's
      a solid pick if you don't have one with `Firing Line`.

        * 笶形Mulligan`: Nope. You shouldn't be missing many shots and the
      opportunity cost of Mulligan is too high. At maximum range on the
      Tribute Hall Ogre, I was hitting at least 50% crits at the base `Recoil`
      and no `Stability` boosts.

        * 笶形Opening Shot`: This is interesting because at 360 RPM you can tap
      out one bullet at a time, turning this in to kind of an incredibly
      high-impact Scout Rifle. Situationally cool but you can still use the SAW
      like this just fine without it. Arguably more of an off-meta PvP pick.

        * 笶形Elemental Capacitor`: While large, the effect of any of these
      increases pales in comparison to significantly higher damage output. You
      can also get each of the benefits through other perks or armor mods. This
      isn't a case in general against `Capacitor`, just on this particular
      weapon.

        * 笶形Disruption Break`: A 50% Kinetic damage bonus debuff is nothing to
      sneeze at! This is a niche pick for when you're up against Arc shields
      because in a Match Game activity, you won't do enough damage to break
      non-matching shields. Myself, if I'm hopping in to a difficult PvE
      activity I'm going to get more general, always-on use from Firing Line.

      Otherwise we're shooing for higher Stability

          With other Guardians at your side, you will rip through hordes of
          aliens no problem. We're taking any Barrel that increases Stability
          and magazine-extended... Magazines. Extended Magazine would normally
          be a hot mess with a base `Reload` so low, but with Field Prep it
          only takes the reload from ~3.5s to ~4.5s (still 1s shorter than the
          base `Reload`).

          With just the core perks, you have an absolutely phenomenal
          Machine Gun! If you get this, you can stop farming because the delta
          between this roll and allll the ones above is minimal.
