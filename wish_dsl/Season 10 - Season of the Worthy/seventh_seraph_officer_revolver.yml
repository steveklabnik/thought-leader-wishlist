    summary: >
      The Officer Revolver is a 180 RPM Kinetic Hand Cannon. See how it compares
      to other 180 RPM Hand Cannons over on
      [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=C1DOIY;xtxS0;DzBRNi)
      Let's start off with Mercules and Kyt from the latest Massive Breakdown
      podcast. Turns out they
      [aren't super hot](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-156-seventh-seraph-weapons-breakdown#t=33:44)
      on the Officer's Revolver.

      
      > **Mercules:** *"Noticably worse than every other Precision hand cannon
      except for Trust, which has better Aim Assist and Recoil then the Officer's.
      Statistically, Officer's is not a super impressive hand cannon."*


      Personally I think that's overstating things. The Service Revolver isn't
      **that** much different in terms of base stats. Trust is clearly better
      but not insanely-so. That being said, it's a 180 and the 180s haven't been
      part of the PvP meta in quite a while. If they were any stonger they'd be
      three-tapping and that would make them far too strong. I agree with
      Mercules' position that given how easy they are to use, they have a
      balanced TTK.



      Now let's check out
      [Drewsky's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3kCNDYUnzM),
      who finds the novel perks like Firmly Planted and Timed Payload
      worth strong consideration. Notably, he had previously
      [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IevtKKR_YxM)
      wishing for more Hand Cannons to have Firmly Planted.

      > **Drewsky:** *"I think this is actually a pretty competitive group of stats
      especially compared to a lot of the other 180 RPM hand cannons. What makes
      it special is that it has a group of pretty competitive stats; maybe not
      the best stats but maybe the best perk pool in combination with those
      stats available on a 180."*

      
      Vorpal and Timed Payload are uniquely available on the Officer Revolver.
      I personally love Vorpal in PvP and love the idea of Timed Payload, but
      I've always liked variety more than than the objective, optimal meta. If
      that partially describes you and you're interested in bagging a few PvP
      rolls, read on!
      
      > **Drewsky:** *"Prioritizing Range while giving the best oveall stat
      package possible."*

      
      I only partially agree with Drewsky here. Going back to our
      understanding of the new compressed range on Hand Cannons, we can cite
      some science from CoolGuy: "(35 Range = 25m falloff, 86 Range = 28m)".
      I'm not sure I'd want to blow valuable Magazine and Barrel slots for one
      to three meters of falloff.
      
      
      The good news is that the wishlist can support multiple perspectives! I'll
      put together a set of Range-prioritizing rolls representing Drewsky's
      perspective, and a set of Handling/Stability prioritizing rolls.

          "Timed Payload?! That's supposed to be positively horrible. Doesn't it
          lower your TTK?" Well, it causes double the flinch and the explosion
          has no range falloff. On a 180 RPM Hand Cannon, Timed Payload
          shouldn't lower the TTK (Drewsky didn't have one on hand to verify the
          math) as you would be getting the kill on the last bullet and not on
          the last 17 damage from Timed Payload.

    summary: >
      There are so many great Hand Cannons for general purpose add shredding
      that you can skip the Officer's Revolver if you don't feel like adding
      another one to your vault. Personally I had a perfectly rolled Service
      Revolver (Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip) and never used it because it couldn't
      one-tap red bar adds - a 140 or 150 with Kill Clip ends up being my
      preferred.


      "OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"

      1. Most importantly, it's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind
      mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.

      1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the
      current Season 10, Hand Cannons can take Overload and Unstoppable mods
      (and in the future will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods
      I'm sure).


      "Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the
      seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else! It can
      also roll with Osmosis but with how great Hard Light and Borealis are, I
      can't imagine preparing for a difficult Strike or Nightmare Hunt and saying
      "Oh let me grab my Officer's Revolver with Osmosis to help us out!" 😉

          This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE
          content. We don't need to be any more specific here; the other columns
          and Masterwork aren't deal-breakers or roll-makers. By itself, Vorpal
          isn't strong enough to recommend this over other Kinetics.
          **WARNING**: It's possible that a PvP roll without a preference in the
          FTTC column will "take" this roll. Bear in mind that might have this
          roll and it would be lit up as a PvP roll.
