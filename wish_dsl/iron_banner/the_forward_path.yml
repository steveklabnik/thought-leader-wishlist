  The Forward Path is a 600 RPM (Adaptive Frame) Kinetic Auto Rifle, brought
  back to us in Season 11 Iron Banner. It was in the first batch of IB weapons
  that featured the new Iron Gaze and Iron Grip perks.

    overview: >
      The Forward Path, perhaps unsurprisingly given where it drops, is an
      absolute bear in PvP. 600 RPM ARs dominated the S11 meta and even though
      they were slightly reined in, they're still phenomenal. It has terrific
      base stats including the highest Aim Assist (71) of any Adaptive AR and
      is just an all-around terrific weapon.

      TFP rolls with sights, not barrels, meaning that the appearance and
      effective range can be materially modified by your choice here.


      * **25m**: Hitmark, Cleanshot

      * **28m**: Red-Dot Micro, Red Dot 2 MOA

      * **39m**: Rifle Scope ST, Rifle Scope SSF. One sticking point for some
      on these long-range scopes is the muzzle flash. The constrained view
      combined with muzzle flash can make target acquisition difficult. *"When you
      get down to 20m, tracking targets becomes an issue."*

          `Tap the Trigger` starts you off stable and `Dynamic Sway Reduction`

          Don't underestimate the effect of MKC. Here's how it plays out:

          * Base: 9 shots (8C, 1B) - 0.8s TTK // 14B 1.3s

          * MKCx1: 7 shots (7C, 0B) - 0.6s TTK // 12B 1.1s


          That's a pretty solid little boost; definitely spicy in sixes.

        overview: >
          Since damage falloff happens at 20m, you want these super zoomed out
          scopes and all the `Stability` and `Handling` we can get. We're only
          going to accept low-zoom scopes because you can only use this as close
          range and long-zoom scope won't have any use (and works against you).

      If you're looking at The Forward Path from the perspective of a PvE player,
      you'll find a standard set of perks from seasons past. As Year 4 rolls on
      and more Kinetic weapons appear with sweet new perks like Surplus,
      Wellspring and One for All, TFP will find trouble shining. These are some
      workhorse rolls that will hold up until that point.

          that melee kill will activate Swashbuckler x5.

          While Feeding Frenzy was slightly nerfed, it's still a terrific perk,
          activating (and stackin) on any kill. With two kills, you're at Outlaw
          level and with three kills you're beyond Outlaw.
