overview: >
  Heritage is a kinetic "precision frame" (slug) shotgun that can drop from the 2nd
  and 3rd encounters of the Deep Stone Crypt raid.  After the initial drop,
  you have a chance of getting additional rolls from the raid's secret chests.

  As of Season 12, it is the only legendary kinetic slug shotgun that is
  viable in leveled content.

    overview: >
      Slug shotguns currently enable some of the highest DPS in the game, and are
      the meta-loadout for boss DPS in a number of encounters, including the
      final boss of the raid.

        overview: >
          Reconstruction is a new perk that currently only drops on
          rolls from the DSC Raid.  Every 4 seconds it loads 10% of the
          base magazine from reserves into the gun, and it maxes out at
          2x the normal magazine size.  It starts at a base of 6 (12) but
          with Extended Mag and the Backup Mag mod you can get up to 8 (16)
          shots without reloading!

          None of the traditional damage perks (Rampage, Kill Clip, Vorpal) are
          available on this gun, so our best bet for the 4th column is another
          new perk, Recombination.  Final blows from all "elemental" sources
          (so, everything that isn't this shotgun) stack up to 10x.  Each stack
          will add 10% for the next Heritage shot (so up to 2x damage).

      Heritage has the highest aim assist of any slug shotgun.  [Drewsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUGZIasUu9o)
      says "this weapon is really comparable to The Chaperone."

      The base one hit kill range is 10.5 meters, you can increase that up to
      11.9m with Killing Wind and Slideshot active.
