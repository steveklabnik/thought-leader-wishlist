      CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI).
      Since this is a controller wishlist, these rolls are all about maxing
      Stability. All of these PvP rolls would be perfectly fine rolls in PvE
      as well.

          This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't
          increase stability but they would make this already great roll even
          better.
        barrels: [Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling]
        magazines: [Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Rapid Hit]
