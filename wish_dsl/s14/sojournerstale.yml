overview: >
  A decent replacement for First In, Last Out that is farmable in Season 14, now that FILO is in
  the world loot pool and hard to farm. Both FILO and Sojourner's Tale are slug
  shotguns used for boss DPS in the Taniks fight in Deep Stone Crypt, as well as
  the Templar and Atheon fights in Vault of Glass.

    overview: >
      These rolls are based on [Ehroar's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBgKZmknK2Y).

      These two weapons are complimentary; this one has higher highs, but is less
      consistent than FILO is. Its perks are more situational, but are likely to be able to
      be procc'd during most fights where FILO is used as well.

      If you don't have a FILO God Roll, then you should absolutely farm this weapon.
      If you do, you still may want to for that extra little oomph.

        name: PvE God Roll (Almost FILO)
        overview: >
          The same roll you can get on First In, Last Out, but with Frenzy instead
          of Vorpal Weapon.
          
          Vorpal adds 15% damage against bosses, and doesn't need
          to be procc'd. Frenzy also gives the 15%, but you need to be "in combat"
          to proc. That being said, you don't need it *out* to activate it, and
          so it's very likely that by the time you're doing boss DPS, it will have
          activated, and so these two rolls are effectively the same in many
          cases.

        name: PvE God Roll (Surrounded)
        overview: >
          You need Surrounded Spec to make this work.

          It is a 30% buff, which is the second-highest possible, but significantly
          higher than Frenzy. FILO can roll with Surrounded too, but it is very
          unlikely that you have one lying around, though check your vault!

          Surrounded wasn't really considered for FILO at the time because no
          fights where you'd use it would proc Surrounded, but both boss fights
          in Vault of Glass are very likely to, and so it's much better there
          than in other raids.

        name: Throw More Grenades
        overview: >
          The highest damage increasing perk, but also the most situational. You
          can get up to three stacks, and it lasts for ten seconds. Each stack
          is 11%. So if you can get two grenade kills within ten seconds of
          a boss DPS phase, you can theoretically do more damage, but this is
          *very* situational.

          Not the best, but still a good slug shotgun for boss DPS.
