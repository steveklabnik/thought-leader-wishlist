          Kickstart is "by far the best trait for fusion rifles in pvp."

          Barrel is dedicated to improving stats. Stability is becoming more
          important on fusion rifles.

          Cornered and Adrenaline Junkie are not as good as Reservoir Burst, but is still good!

      These rolls are based on
      [Fallout's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRvLO1iPB_A).

      Stability matters most on fusion rifles in PvP, because you want to kill
      in one charge, and you need to hit as many bolts as possible to do that.

          If you get an adept one, Adept Charge Time is good. Adept Stability
          is also good.

          Maybe better than Null Composure?

          Use an Adept Charge Time mod.
