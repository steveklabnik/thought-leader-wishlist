overview: >
  First In, Last Out, affectionately referred to as "FILO," is a slug
  shotgun used for boss DPS in the Taniks fight in Deep Stone Crypt, as well as
  the Templar and Atheon fights in Vault of Glass.

  I am writing this summary during Season 14, and at this point, FILO is in the
  world loot pool, and hard to get. You may consider trying to get a Sojourner's
  Tale instead; FILO is more consistent than it is, but basically impossible to
  farm, and Sojourner's Tale has higher possible DPS.
