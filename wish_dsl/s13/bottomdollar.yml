    summary: >
      These rolls are based on
      [Aztecross' review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUa5FB0220c).

      He mentions that there are a ton of viable options. There's so many
      possible perk combinations here. There are also a few bad perks, but
      you should think about combinations more deeply.
