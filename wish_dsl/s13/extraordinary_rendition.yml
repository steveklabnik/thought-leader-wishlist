      The cornerstone of both PvE and PvP are `Surplus`. If you end up with a
      "PvE roll" that also happens to have super high Stability, then you've
      got the Holy Grail. Congrats! For an explanation of these rolls, please
      read further down towards the specific PvE and PvP sections.

      EA needs a lot of help in the Stability department, which is the
      entire focus of these two rolls. At best, you'll be able to get Stability
      up from `17` to `52` plus the benefits coming from Surplus and Tap
      the Trigger. This puts you way above the base Stability on the
      vaunted Antiope-D and other Precision Frame SMGs. The Recoil is `97`
      so YMMV on whether or not a Counterbalance mod is required (I
      suggest an Icarus Mod otherwise).

          Same as the above, minus `Tap the Trigger`. Stability is so
          solid without it that we still have a very good PvP roll.

      With `Surplus`, `One for All` and `Frenzy` in the EA perk
      pool, we're looking at a strong contender for one of the best kinetic
      weapons of all time (second only to the Ikelos SMG). `Surplus` improves
      Stability and Reload and `One for All` and `Frenzy` provide a tremendous
      damage boost and leaves your mod slot free for Minor, Major or Boss Spec.

          This is going to be immensely helpful in **high tier content** where you
          aren't able to proc damage perks off of kills. While `Surplus` will be
          boosting Stability, the Stability is so low and difficult to manage on
          console that we'll continue to crave it as a backstop for when we're at
          lower tiers of `Surplus` benefits.
