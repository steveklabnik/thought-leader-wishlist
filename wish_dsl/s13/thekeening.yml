    summary: >
      These rolls are based on
      [True Vanguard's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QAbg15vb20).

      He mentions that there are a ton of viable options. There's so many
      possible perk combinations here. There are also a few bad perks, but
      you should think about combinations more deeply.
