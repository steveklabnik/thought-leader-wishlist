overview: >
  Shadow Price is a 450 RPM Precision Frame, Arc Energy Auto Rifle, offered
  as a Nightfall-exclusive reward beginning in Season 13. It's the only 450 RPM
  Auto Rifle dropping apart from the Kinetic Seventh Seraph Carbine;
  [compare them](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=Cc8zza;BdCxNP)
  over on light.gg. Shadow Price has by far the better perk pool (One for All,
  Surplus, Feeding Frenzy...) whereas the Carbine can create Warmind Cells,
  which alone is a reason to use it.

    overview: >
      450s haven't been great in PvP since the first year of Destiny 2. 600 RPMs
      like the Gnawing Hunger and Summoner still reign supreme, and will continue
      to do so until 450s are buffed. What makes the Shadow
      Price even less desirable for PvP is the lack of PvP perks that AR users
      would find interesting in either column. No Dynamic Sway, Tap the Trigger,
      etc. which makes sense since it's a reward for a PvE activity. Once the
      Grandmaster NFs appear and Adept mods are accessible, perhaps Adept
      Counterbalance, Stability, etc. could make it more desireable. Really
      though, until they're buffed, 450 RPMs may be frustrating to deploy against
      meta weapons.

        name: Crushing Darkness
        overview: >
          With either Arrowhead Brake or Chambered Compensator + Counterbalance,
          you can hit `100` Recoil. Everythign else is this roll is about
          maximzing Stability. The final column doesn't
          have any must-have perks; anything there is gravy. Sure Swashbuckler
          would be nice to have, but it doesn't complete a picture, so I've left
          the final column empty. With at least two abilities active, Surplus is
          going to grant a noticeable improvement to Stability, Handling and
          Reload speed giving this roll a snappy, almost Lightweight-Frame feel.

    overview: >
      450s (and ARs in general) are in a tough spot for PvE.
      [Ehroar demonstrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeyr60J8K6A)
      this comprehensively: they have a confusing damage profile compared to
      other alternatives in that slot. If Shadow Price were a kinetic, perhaps
      less so, but the Energy slot is so loaded with great weapons that it's
      hard to imagine this being your top choice in its current state. That
      being said, frame buffs are always a thing and 450s seem long overdue
      for one!

        name: Overflowing Darkness (Aztec's Pick)
        overview: >
          One for All is a 33% damage boost after tagging three targets. Pair it
          with Overflow you've got a deep mag to burn down while OFA is active.
          If you want this to feel like a laser, Arrowhead Brake is your pick in
          the first column, taking the Recoil from 79 to 100. It also boosts
          Handling by nearly 20%, which you'll notice on ready, stow and aiming.

        overview: >
          One for All is a 33% damage boost after tagging three targets.
          Eventually you'll need to reload and once you hit FFx2, you're golden.
          If you want this to feel like a laser, Arrowhead Brake is your pick in
          the first column, taking the Recoil from 79 to 100. It also boosts
          Handling by nearly 20%, which you'll notice on ready, stow and aiming.

        name: Steady Sparks in the Night
        overview: >
          On full-auto weapons, Dragonfly can be tough to proc. 450s are right
          in that sweet spot where at medium-to-longer ranges, getting Dragonfly
          to proc regularly is a real possibility. To help with that, we're
          going to go for better Recoil and Stability with the rest of the roll.
