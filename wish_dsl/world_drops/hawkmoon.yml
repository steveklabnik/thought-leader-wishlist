overview: >
  Hawkmoon is a 140 RPM Exotic Hand Cannon, re-issued from Destiny 1 featuring
  random rolls! The base stats are terrific and it's hard to argue that any
  single roll is "bad" per se, but there are certainly some rolls that are more
  desireable than others from a min/max'ers perspective.


  If you haven't already **complete the catalyst**! Completing it grants you the
  masterwork:
  
  > "Increased magazine size. Grants increased handling, reload and weapon range based on the number of
  stacks of Paracausal Charge."


  I'm going to be using video reviews from a few folks in choosing which rolls
  to share.

  From Drewsky's, here are some effective ranges:


    | Perks          | Range |
    |----------------|-------|
    | Corkscrew | 31.2m      |
    | Smallbore  |   31.5m   |
    | Hammer-Forged    |   31.5m   |
    | Full Bore   |   32.5m   |
    | Smallbore + Rangefinder   | 34.2m |
    | Hammer-Forged + Rangefinder  |   34.5m   |
    | Hammer-Forged + Killing Wind (Active)   |   35m   |
    | Full Bore + Rangefinder  |   35.5m (est.)  |


  There aren't any PvE rolls featured below. Watching Hawkmoon w/Paracausal x7
  chunk down enemies is truly rewarding (as is hearing CAWWW!). There are no
  perks or combinations of perks that make a roll more or less effective in PvE
  beyond whatever personal preference adds consistency for you. There's an
  argument to be made that the answer to that question is "Use PvP rolls which
  are all about adding consistency" 🙃

          The effect to which Combat Grip straights out recoil will surprise
          you. [Have a look!](https://youtu.be/K4nBwU6opJk?t=386) All around
          Range and Stability benefits from the combo of Smallbore Rangefinder
          make this a terrific roll.

          Same as the above roll except significanly less `Handling`. "It's a
          half step behind the best roll."

          The catalyst does nothing for Stability, so you want as much as you
          can get. This roll will out-range any 140 RPM Hand Cannon currently
          in the game.

          base: 
            barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling]

          Pretty straightforward set of suggestions here. Avoid Moving Target
          because you can get the same bonus from just throwing a Hand Cannon
          AA mod on your helmet.
